kick
====

So this is another attempt at setting up a local git directory. Then pushing it up to git and working on understanding how to monitor changes.
What I understand so far
1: git init a local directory
2: git add .   adds all the files in the directory  or git add <files>
3: git commit -m 'initial commit'
4: git pull kick kick
5: git push origin <branch>


also git wtf
git publish-branch repository   (eg git@github.com:pointdexter/kick.git  for the repository)


So what to do next:

set a local wolfcms and git init 

then adapt the kickstarter to it

and learn about branches and how to follow your changes locally with git...then push it.
